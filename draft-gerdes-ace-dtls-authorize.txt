Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Profile for Authentication and
            Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)
                 draft-gerdes-ace-dtls-authorize-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a profile for delegating client
   authentication and authorization in a constrained environment for
   establishing a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) channel
   between resource-constrained nodes.  The protocol relies on DTLS for
   communication security between entities in a constrained network.  A
   resource-constrained node can use this protocol to delegate
   management of authorization information to a trusted host with less
   severe limitations regarding processing power and memory.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a profile of the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  In this profile, a client and a resource
   server use CoAP [RFC7252] over DTLS [RFC6347] to communicate.  The
   client uses an access token, bound to a key (the proof-of-possession
   key) to authorize its access to the resource server.  DTLS provides

   communication security, proof of possession, and server
   authentication.  Optionally the client and the resource server may
   also use CoAP over DTLS to communicate with the authorization server.
   The DTLS PSK handshake [RFC4279] provides the proof-of-possession for
   the key tied to the access token.  Furthermore the psk_identity
   parameter in the DTLS PSK handshake is used to transfer the access
   token from the client to the resource server.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

2.  Protocol Overview

   The CoAP-DTLS profile for ACE specifies the transfer of
   authentication and, if necessary, authorization information between C
   and RS during setup of a DTLS session for CoAP messaging.  It also
   specifies how a Client can use CoAP over DTLS to retrieve an Access
   Token from AS for a protected resource hosted on RS.

   This profile requires a Client (C) to retrieve an Access Token for
   the resource(s) it wants to access on a Resource Server (RS) as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  Figure 1 shows the typical
   message flow in this scenario (messages in square brackets are
   optional):

      C                            RS                   AS
      | [-- Resource Request --->] |                     |
      |                            |                     |
      | [<----- AS Information --] |                     |
      |                            |                     |
      | --- Token Request  ----------------------------> |
      |                            |                     |
      | <---------------------------- Access Token ----- |
      |                             + Client Information |


                   Figure 1: Retrieving an Access Token

   To determine the AS in charge of a resource hosted at the RS, C MAY
   send an initial Unauthorized Resource Request message to RS.  RS then
   denies the request and sends the address of its AS back to C.

   Instead of the initial Unauthorized Resource Request message, C MAY
   look up the desired resource in a resource directory (cf.
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory]).

   Once C knows AS's address, it can send an Access Token request to the
   /token endpoint at the AS as specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz],
   optionally containing a parameter "profile" that indicates its
   preferred authorization profiles.  If C wants to use the CoAP
   RawPublicKey mode as described in Section 9 of RFC 7252 [1] it MUST
   provide a key or key identifier within a "cnf" object in the token
   request.  If AS decides that the request is to be authorized it
   generates an access token response for C containing a "profile"
   parameter with the value "coap_dtls" to indicate that this profile
   MUST be used for communication between C and RS.  Is also adds a
   "cnf" parameter with additional data for the establishment of a
   secure DTLS-channel between C and RS.

   The Access Token returned by AS then can be used by C to establish a
   new DTLS session with RS.  To do so, C MUST upload the Access Token
   to the "/authz-info" resource on RS before it can start the DTLS
   handshake for CoAP RawPublicKey (RPK) mode, and MAY upload the Access
   Token to the "/authz-info" resource on RS for CoAP PreSharedKey (PSK)
   mode.  Figure 2 depicts the common protocol flow for the DTLS profile
   after C has retrieved the Access Token from AS.

      C                            RS                   AS
      | [--- Access Token ------>] |                     |
      |                            |                     |
      | <== DTLS channel setup ==> |                     |
      |                            |                     |
      | == Authorized Request ===> |                     |
      |                            |                     |
      | <=== Protected Resource == |                     |


                        Figure 2: Protocol overview

   The following sections specify how CoAP is used to interchange
   access-related data between RS and AS so that AS can provide C and RS
   with sufficient information to establish a secure channel, and convey
   authorization information specific for this communication
   relationship to RS.

   Depending on the desired CoAP security mode, the Client-to-AS
   request, AS-to-Client response and DTLS session establishment carry
   slightly different information.  Section 3 addresses the use of raw
   public keys while Section 4 defines how pre-shared keys are used in
   this profile.

2.1.  Unauthorized Resource Request Message

   The optional Unauthorized Resource Request message is a request for a
   resource hosted by RS for which no proper authorization is granted.
   RS MUST treat any CoAP request for a resource other than "/authz-
   info" as Unauthorized Resource Request message when any of the
   following holds:

   o  The request has been received on an unprotected channel.

   o  RS has no valid access token for the sender of the request
      regarding the requested action on that resource.

   o  RS has a valid access token for the sender of the request, but
      this does not allow the requested action on the requested
      resource.

   Note: These conditions ensure that RS can handle requests
   autonomously once access was granted and a secure channel has been
   established between C and RS.  The resource "/authz-info" must be
   publicly accessible to upload new access tokens to RS (cf.
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]).

   Unauthorized Resource Request messages MUST be denied with a client
   error response.  In this response, the Resource Server SHOULD provide
   proper AS Information to enable the Client to request an access token
   from RS's Authorization Server as described in Section 2.2.

   The response code MUST be 4.01 (Unauthorized) in case the sender of
   the Unauthorized Resource Request message is not authenticated, or if
   RS has no valid access token for C.  If RS has an access token for C
   but not for the resource that C has requested, RS MUST reject the
   request with a 4.03 (Forbidden).  If RS has an access token for C but
   it does not cover the action C requested on the resource, RS MUST
   reject the request with a 4.05 (Method Not Allowed).

   Note:  The use of the response codes 4.03 and 4.05 is intended to
      prevent infinite loops where a dumb Client optimistically tries to
      access a requested resource with any access token received from
      AS.  As malicious clients could pretend to be C to determine C's
      privileges, these detailed response codes must be used only when a
      certain level of security is already available which can be
      achieved only when the Client is authenticated.

2.2.  AS Information

   The AS Information is sent by RS as a response to an Unauthorized
   Resource Request message (see Section 2.1) to point the sender of the
   Unauthorized Resource Request message to RS's AS.  The AS information
   is a set of attributes containing an absolute URI (see Section 4.3 of
   [RFC3986]) that specifies the AS in charge of RS.

   TBD: We might not want to add more parameters in the AS information
   because
      this would not only reveal too much information about RS's
      capabilities to unauthorized peers but also be of little value as
      C cannot really trust that information anyway.

   The message MAY also contain a nonce generated by RS to ensure
   freshness in case that the RS and AS do not have synchronized clocks.

   Figure 3 shows an example for an AS Information message payload using
   CBOR diagnostic notation.

       4.01 Unauthorized
       Content-Format: application/ace+cbor
       {AS: "coaps://as.example.com/token",
        nonce: h'e0a156bb3f'}

                 Figure 3: AS Information payload example

   In this example, the attribute AS points the receiver of this message
   to the URI "coaps://as.example.com/token" to request access
   permissions.  The originator of the AS Information payload (i.e., RS)
   uses a local clock that is loosely synchronized with a time scale
   common between RS and AS (e.g., wall clock time).  Therefore, it has
   included a parameter "nonce" for replay attack prevention (c.f.
   Section 5.2).

   Note: There is an ongoing discussion how freshness of access tokens
      can be achieved in constrained environments.  This specification
      for now assumes that RS and AS do not have a common understanding
      of time that allows RS to achieve its security objectives without
      explicitly adding a nonce.

   The examples in this document are written in CBOR diagnostic notation
   to improve readability.  Figure 4 illustrates the binary encoding of
   the message payload shown in Figure 3.

3.  RawPublicKey Mode

   To retrieve an access token for the resource that C wants to access,
   C requests an Access Token from AS.  The Access Token request is
   constructed as specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  The
   parameter "profile" MUST include "coap_dtls" to indicate C's support
   for this profile and MAY include other profiles as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]).  C MUST add a "cnf" object carrying
   either its raw public key or a unique identifier for a public key
   that it has previously made known to AS.

   An example Access Token request from C to RS is depicted in Figure 5.

      POST coaps://as.example.com/token
      Content-Format: application/cbor
      {
        grant_type:    client_credentials,
        aud:           "tempSensor4711",
        token_type:    pop,
        alg:           ES256,
        profile:       [ coap_dtls ]
        cnf: {

            y:   h'TODOY'
          }
        }
      }

   TODO

3.2.  DTLS Channel Setup Between C and RS

   When C receives an Access Token from AS, it checks if the payload
   contains an "access_token" field and a "cnf" object.  Before
   initiating the DTLS handshake with RS, C MUST send a "POST" request
   containing the new Access Token to the "/authz-info" resource hosted
   by RS.  If this operation yields a positive response, C SHOULD
   proceed to establish a new DTLS channel with RS.  To use raw public
   key mode, C MUST use the same public key as its certificate in the
   DTLS handshake that was used for constructing the Access Token.

   Note:  According to [RFC7252], CoAP implementations MUST support the
      ciphersuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 [RFC7251] and the
      NIST P-256 curve.  C is therefore expected to offer at least this
      ciphersuite to RS.

   The Access Token is constructed by AS such that RS can associate the
   Access Token with the Client's public key.

   TODO

4.  PreSharedKey Mode

   To retrieve an access token for the resource that C wants to access,
   C requests an Access Token from AS.  The Access Token request is
   constructed as specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  The
   parameter "profile" MUST include "coap_dtls" to indicate C's support
   for this profile and MAY include other profiles as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]).  C MAY add a "cnf" object carrying a
   symmetric key to be used by AS to construct the proof-of-possession
   token.

   If a symmetric proof-of-possession key (c.f.
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]) is requested C must ensure that the
   Access Token request is sent over a secure channel that guarantees
   authentication, message integrity and confidentiality.  This could
   be, e.g., a DTLS channel (for "coaps") or an OSCOAP
   [I-D.selander-ace-object-security] exchange (for "coap").

   An example Access Token request from C to RS is depicted in Figure 6.

4.1.  AS-to-Client Response

   When AS has received an Access Token request it has to evaluate the
   access request information contained therein.  To grant access to the
   requested resource, AS constructs an Access Token as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  For use with this profile, the attribute
   "profile" is set to "coap_dtls".

   Depending on the requested token type and algorithm in the Access
   Token request, AS adds the following Client Information to the
   response:

   A newly generated session key.  This specification describes a method
   for AS to derive a session key from a shared secret with RS, and
   attributes from the Access Token request such as the "aud" and
   "client_secret" parameters.  The generated key is transferred as
   parameter "k" in a "COSE_Key" object.  (See Section 7 of cose-msg
   [2].)

   AS SHOULD set Max-Age according to the Access Token lifetime in its
   response.

   Figure 7 shows an example AS response containing a new Access Token.
   The information is transferred as a CBOR data structure as specified
   in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  The Max-Age option tells the
   receiving Client how long this token will be valid.

4.2.  DTLS Channel Setup Between C and RS

   When C receives an Access Token from AS, it checks if the payload
   contains an "access_token" field and a "cnf" object.  With this
   information C can initiate establishment of a new DTLS channel with
   RS.  To use DTLS with pre-shared keys, C follows the PSK key exchange
   algorithm specified in Section 2 of [RFC4279], with the following
   additional requirements:

   1.  C sets the psk_identity field of the ClientKeyExchange message to
       the contents of the "access_token" field received from the AS.

   2.  C uses the key conveyed in the "cnf" field of the AS response as
       PSK when constructing the premaster secret.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-DTLS                 September 2016


   Note1: As RS cannot provide C with a meaningful PSK identity hint in

      response to C's ClientHello message, RS SHOULD NOT send a
      ServerKeyExchange message.

   Note2: According to <xref target="RFC7252"/>, CoAP implementations
   MUST
      support the ciphersuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 [RFC6655].  C
      is therefore expected to offer at least this ciphersuite to RS.

   Note3: The session key is constructed by AS such that RS can derive
   the
      PSK from the contents of the psk_identity contains in C's
      ClientHello message (refer to Section 4.5 for details).

4.3.  Authorized Communication

   Once a DTLS channel has been established as described in Section 4.2
   C is authorized to access resources covered by the Access Token it
   has presented in the "psk_identity".

   On the server side (i.e., RS), successful establishment of the DTLS
   channel between C and RS ties the authorization information contained
   in the "psk_identity" field to this channel.  Any request that RS
   receives on this channel is checked against these authorization
   rules.  Incoming CoAP requests that are not authorized with respect
   to this Access Token MUST be rejected by RS with 4.01 response as
   described in Section 2.1.

   RS SHOULD treat an incoming CoAP request as authorized if the
   following holds:

   1.  The message was received on a secure channel that has been
       established using the procedure defined in Section 4.2.

   2.  The authorization information tied to the secure channel is
       valid.

   3.  The request is destined for RS.

   4.  The resource URI specified in the request is covered by the
       authorization information.

   5.  The request method is an authorized action on the resource with
       respect to the authorization information.

   Note that the authorization information is not restricted to a single
   resource URI.  For example, role-based authorization can be used to



Gerdes, et al.           Expires March 20, 2017                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-DTLS                 September 2016


   authorize a collection of semantically connected resources
   simultaneously.  Implicit authorization also provides access rights
   to authenticated clients for all actions on all resources that RS
   offers.  As a result, C can use the same DTLS channel not only for
   subsequent requests for the same resource (e.g. for block-wise
   transfer as defined in [RFC7959] or refreshing observe-relationships
   [RFC7641]) but also for requests to distinct resources.

   Incoming CoAP requests received on a secure channel according to the
   procedure defined in Section 4.2 MUST be rejected

   1.  with response code 4.03 (Forbidden) when the resource URI
       specified in the request is not covered by the authorization
       information, and

   2.  with response code 4.05 (Method Not Allowed) when the resource
       URI specified in the request covered by the authorization
       information but not the requested action.

   C cannot always know a priori if a Authorized Resource Request will
   succeed.  If C repeatedly gets AS Information messages (cf.
   Section 2.2) as response to its requests, it SHOULD request a new
   Access Token from AS to continue communication with RS.

4.4.  Dynamic Update of Authorization Information

   Once a security association exists between a Client and a Resource
   Server, the Client can update the authorization information stored at
   RS at any time.  To do so, the Client requests a new Access Token for
   the intended action on the respective resource and from AS as
   described in Section 4.

   Note:  Requesting a new Access Token also can be a Client's reaction
      on a 4.03 or 4.05 error that it has received in response to a
      request over a DTLS channel that was setup as specified in
      Section 4.2.

   Figure 9 depicts the message flow where C requests a new Access Token
   after a security association between C and RS has been established
   using this protocol.

              Figure 9: Overview of Dynamic Update Operation

   The major difference between dynamic update of authorization
   information and the initial handshake is that the DTLS session
   between C and RS may be renegotiated with the new Access Token as
   described in Section 4.4.1.

4.4.1.  Handling of Ticket Transfer Messages

   If the security association with RS still exists and RS has indicated
   support for session renegotiation according to [RFC5746], the new
   Access Token SHOULD be used to renegotiate the existing DTLS session.
   In this case, the Access Token is used as "psk_identity" as defined
   in Section 4.2.  Otherwise, the Client MUST perform a new DTLS
   handshake according to Section 4.2 that replaces the existing DTLS
   session.

   After successful completion of the DTLS handshake RS updates the
   existing authorization information for C according to the new Access
   Token.

   Note:  No mutual authentication between C and RS is required for
      dynamic updates when a DTLS channel exists that has been
      established as defined in Section 4.2.  RS only needs to verify
      the authenticity and integrity of the Access Token issued by AS
      which is achieved by having performed a successful DTLS handshake
      with the Access Token as psk_identity.  This could even be done
      within the existing DTLS session while the previous Access Token

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-DTLS                 September 2016


      is still valid.  To do so, a newly retrieved Access Token would be
      transmitted to the "/token" endpoint of RS.

4.5.  DTLS PSK Generation Methods

   One goal of this profile is to provide for a DTLS PSK shared between
   C and RS.  AS and RS MUST negotiate the method for the DTLS PSK
   generation.

4.5.1.  DTLS PSK Transfer

   The DTLS PSK is generated by AS and transmitted to C and RS using a
   secure channel.

   The DTLS PSK transfer method is defined as follows:

   o  AS generates the DTLS PSK using an algorithm of its choice

   o  AS MUST include a representation of the DTLS PSK in the Access
      Token and encrypt it together with all other information with a
      key K(AS,RS) it shares with RS.  How AS and RS exchange K(AS,RS)
      is not in the scope of this document.  AS and RS MAY use their
      preshared key as K(AS,RS).

   o  AS MUST include a representation of the DTLS PSK in "cnf" field of
      its response to C.

   o  AS must ensure that the DTLS PSK is transferred to C using
      encrypted channels.

   o  RS MUST decrypt the session key using K(AS,RS)

4.5.2.  Distributed Key Derivation

   AS generates a DTLS PSK for C which is transmitted using a secure
   channel.  RS generates its own version of the DTLS PSK using the
   information provided in the "psk_identity" parameter of the
   ClientHello request.

   The distributed key derivation method is defined as follows:

   o  AS and RS both generate the DTLS PSK using the information
      included in the Access Token.  They use a key derivation algorithm
      on the Access Token with a shared key K(AS,RS).  The result serves
      as the DTLS PSK.  How AS and RS exchange K(AS,RS) is not in the
      scope of this document.  They MAY use their preshared key as
      K(AS,RS).  (TODO: Negotiation of the key derivation algorithm
      between AS and RS.)

   o  AS MUST include a representation of the DTLS PSK in the "cnf"
      field in its response to C which MUST be sent over a secure
      channel.

   o  AS MUST NOT include a representation of the DTLS PSK in the Access
      Token.

   o  (TBD) AS MUST NOT encrypt the Access Token.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO

5.1.  Unprotected AS Information

   Initially, no secure channel exists to protect the communication
   between C and RS.  Thus, C cannot determine if the AS information
   contained in an unprotected response from RS to an unauthorized
   request (c.f. {#as-info}) is authentic.  It is therefore advisable to
   provide C with a (possibly hard-coded) list of trustworthy
   authorization servers.  AS information responses referring to a URI
   not listed there would be ignored.

5.2.  Use of Nonces for Replay Protection

   RS may add a nonce to the AS Information message sent as a response
   to an unauthorized request to ensure freshness of an Access Token
   subsequently presented to RS.  While a timestamp of some granularity
   would be sufficient to protect against replay attacks, using
   randomized nonce is preferred to prevent disclosure of information
   about RS's internal clock characteristics.

5.3.  Privacy

   An unprotected response to an unauthorized request (c.f. {#as-info})
   may disclose information about RS and/or its existing relationship
   with C.  It is advisable to include as little information as possible
   in an unencrypted response.  When a DTLS session between C and RS
   already exists, more detailed information may be included with an
   error response to provide C with sufficient information to react on
   that particular error.
